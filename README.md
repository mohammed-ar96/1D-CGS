# 1D-CGS

1D-CGS is a lightweight and efficient deep learning model that combines 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) with GraphSAGE to rank influential nodes in complex networks. The model uses only two simple yet informative structural features: node degree and average neighbor degree. It is significantly faster and more accurate than existing deep learning approaches like RCNN and MRCNN.
Parts of the implementation for the RCNN and MRCNN models used in our baseline comparisons are adapted from the open-source repository:
